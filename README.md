# Master_Host_Listing_Check
What is MHL check doing:

The python script will find if there is any IP address that has been decommissioned once, but that reallocated now. So that the decommission line can be deleted. Also, it will find if there is any IPs that has been decommission twice or if there are any identical lines.
